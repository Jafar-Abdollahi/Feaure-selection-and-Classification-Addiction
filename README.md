# Feaure-selection-and-Classification-Mortality estimates 
In this work, the use of Mortality estimates data is proposed to generate recognition and classification of the Mortality estimates model through ensemble learning techniques, the use of a genetic algorithm for a feature selection is presented, reducing the original size of the dataset used. For the evaluation of this process, six different classification methods are applied, Decision Trees (DT) k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support-Vector Machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and Logistic regression (LR). Finally, a comparison of the models obtained, based on the accuracy, is performed, in order to identify the classification method that presents the best performance in the development of a model.
